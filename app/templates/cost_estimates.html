        <li><strong>Expert Consultation:</strong> Cost estimates were refined based on input from developers, QA specialists, and project managers.</li>
        <li><strong>Contingency Budget:</strong> A 15% buffer is included to account for unexpected expenses, bringing the final estimated cost to <strong>$97,750</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
